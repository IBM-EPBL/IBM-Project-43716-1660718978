Phishing is a type of social engineering attack often used to steal user data, including login credentials and credit card numbers.Phishing attacks target holes in systems that exist because of the involvement of humans. Users are the weakest link in the security chain since many cyber attacks are spread via methods that take advantage of flaws in end usersMany of the recently proposed phishing mitigation strategies are surveyed.
In order to show how phishing detection strategies fit into the broader mitigation process, a high-level overview of the many types of phishing mitigation approaches is also offered, including: detection, offensive defense, rectification, and prevention.Phishing attack is used to steal confidential information of a user. Fraud websites appears like genuine websites with the logo and graphics of genuine website.This project aims to detect fraud or phishing website using machine learning techniques.

# Data Selection
The dataset is downloaded from "acces resources" under guided project.A collection of website URLs for 11000 websites. Each sample has 30 website parameters and a class label identifying it as a phishing website or not (1 or -1)
# Models & Training
Before stating the ML model training, the data is split into 60-40 i.e., 6600 training samples & 4400 testing samples. From the dataset, it is clear that this is a supervised machine learning task.
This data set comes under classification problem, as the input URL is classified as phishing (1) or legitimate (0).
# Technologies Used
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Flask
- Scikit learn
